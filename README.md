# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-1990s-Movies-on-Netflix

In this project, we will perform an exploratory data analysis on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about movies released in the 1990s. Given Netflix's extensive catalog, our focus will be on understanding the characteristics of movies from this nostalgic decade. 
We will begin by reading and examining the dataset, identifying and handling any missing values, and filtering the data to include only movies released between 1990 and 1999. 
Our analysis will determine the most frequent movie duration during this period and visualize the distribution of movie durations. 
Additionally, we will count the number of short action movies (those with a duration of less than 90 minutes) to understand trends in movie lengths. This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of 1990s movies, leveraging the Netflix dataset to offer valuable insights for a production company specializing in nostalgic content.
